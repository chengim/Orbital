Title: UnearthWorks

Main Idea: 

Rationale of our proposal:
=> Nowadays, the online writing community is getting increasingly popular. There are many websites providing a platform for writers to write and share, but no websites that compile and organizes these precious resources online. Hence, many great works are being buried.

Thus, our mission is to unearth them!

Purpose of website
=> Provide a platform for users to easily search and access online novels/ebooks

What do we do?
=> We organize these novels in a systematic way, so that they can be accessed easily.
	For e.g
	-diff genres
	-diff authors
	-Ratings

Interface/functionalities
=> Users: they will be able to...
	-comment
	-upvote/downvote
	-bookmarks/favourite list
	-reccomendation(works not found in list)
	-report(e.g broken link/plagarism)
=> Website: what it provides...
	-Hall of Fame/Hell (based on ratings/votes)
	-Editor's reccomendation
	-Stories will have short customised description/ratings
	-Link to stories
